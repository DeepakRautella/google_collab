        "Ans1. The naive approach in machine learning refers to a simple algorithm that assumes independence between features. One example is the Naive Bayes algorithm, which uses Bayes' theorem and assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label. The formula for Naive Bayes is:\n",

        "P(y | x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = (P(y) * P(x_1 | y) * P(x_2 | y) * ... * P(x_n | y)) / P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans2.The assumptions of feature independence in the Naive Approach are that the features are conditionally independent given the class label. This means that the presence or value of one feature does not affect or depend on the presence or value of other features when the class label is known.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans3.The Naive Approach typically handles missing values by ignoring them during training and prediction. It assumes that missing values occur randomly and does not account for their impact. Some implementations may impute missing values using simple strategies like mean or mode imputation before applying the naive approach.\n",

        "Ans7.Laplace smoothing, also known as add-one smoothing, is a technique used in the Naive Approach to handle unseen features. It adds a small constant value to the frequency count of each feature to avoid zero probabilities. This ensures that no feature has zero probability and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
